# Ethereum in Simple Terms

Ethereum is regularly mentioned alongside Bitcoin as one of the most popular decentralized cryptocurrencies. But what is Ethereum? What makes it different from Bitcoin and why there is so much hype around it?

Ethereum was first proposed in 2013 but came to prominence in 2015, some six years after Bitcoin. The Ethereum platform was initially proposed and developed by Vitalik Buterin, along with several other contributors and co-founders. 

At this point in time, Ethereum is likely to be one of the biggest open blockchains in the world with over a million independent software engineers working on improving various aspects of the blockchain and building services on top of it.

Ethereum proposed a different approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain, in comparison to existing blockchain projects like Bitcoin. Where Bitcoin is a store of value and limited to transfers of Bitcoin from one address to another, Ethereum is the foundation for building decentralized services for all kinds of things.

## Why Ethereum

Any software engineer without the need for someone’s permission can use the Ethereum platform to build a decentralized service. For as long as Ethereum is running and there is at least one network server (also known as node) the services built on Ethereum will remain operational and accessible to the public. Taking into account that anyone can operate an Ethereum node, censoring such network is extremely difficult if not impossible.

The terms Ethereum network, Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum platform usually mean the same thing. The Ethereum network consists of all servers worldwide that run Ethereum node software.

Bitcoin’s purpose is to provide a reliable store of value and alternative to digital payments. Ethereum’s purpose is to enable developers to create decentralized applications and services that operate on an open publicly-accessible platform. The platform guarantees that services running on it operate in a transparent manner and without the potential for any external influence to change or cheat the system. 

For example, a lottery app built on Ethereum cannot cheat. It’s transparent in the way it operates and works exactly the way it was programmed. Anyone with sufficient technical knowledge can check the logic powering the service and confirm there are no workarounds or vulnerabilities. 

Conversely, with a regular lottery app or website, there is no way of checking the code. You have to place your trust in the developer of the service. 

## Ethereum Blockchain

Ethereum is a blockchain, a digital log that tracks every action (aka transaction) that's made on Ethereum blockchain. A transaction ranges from a simple transfer of Ether tokens from one wallet address to another, to more complex processes such as the execution of a decentralized program (aka, smart contract---more on these in a moment!). 

Every transaction made on the Ethereum blockchain, reaches all the nodes within a few seconds. It should be noted that every Ethereum node holds the same live copy of the blockchain. There is a consensus algorithm in place that ensures that all nodes on the network end up with the same copy of the blockchain. Each node is Ethereum blockchain. All nodes talk to each other. If one is down the others are there to keep the system running.

So, think of Ethereum as a global computer that's open to everyone to participate in.

To sum up, nodes are vital for the proper operation of the Ethereum blockchain. Nodes ensure decentralization, availability 24/7 and censroship-resistance. Anyone can unconditionally operate an Ethereum node. The more nodes there are online the more secure Ethereum blockchain is.

Every node individually validates every transaction, ensuring only legitimate transactions enter the blockchain. A node cannot cheat the rest of the network. 

## Ethereum Currency

Ethereum network nodes earn Ether (also called Ethereum), which is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is like fuel for validating transactions on the Ethereum network. The users interacting with services on the Ethereum blockchain pay this in a form of small transaction fees.

The emission of new Ether currency into the network is encoded into Ethereum protocol and is there to encourage people to run Ethereum nodes. The supply of new Ether is limited to 18 million tokens per year, although that limit has never been reached. The supply of new Ether has averaged just under 9 million per year since 2015.

There are several core differences between the operation of Ethereum and Bitcoin regarding the creation and distribution. For example, once the total number of Bitcoins reaches 21 million, no more Bitcoin will be created. Whereas, there is no such upper limit to the total Ethereum supply.

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a piece of code that works on a blockchain to enforce the terms of a contractual agreement. In the simplest of terms, a smart contract is an example of a "when X takes place, do Y" scenario.

Every application/service residing on Ethereum or alike blockchain essentially consists of smart contracts. If someone decides to build a lottery on Ethereum it would be basically a set of smart contracts interacting with each other.

To elaborate further, an engineer can program a smart contract that holds a balance of X Ether, that is programmed to pay out its entire balance when someone provides the correct solution to a puzzle outlined in the smart contract. When a user submits the correct answer, the smart contract executes its code and pays out the full balance to the user's Ethereum wallet address. The contract may also for instance require that all participants pay an entry fee to the contract (which will also be sent to the winner) to be able to participate in the challenge.

The development and use of smart contracts are one of the fundamental properties that differentiate Ethereum from other blockchains. It’s what makes it possible to build all kinds of services on Ethereum that can go far beyond the mere transfer of currency tokens from one address to another.

The major difference between a regular physical paper contract and a smart contract is enforcement. Where a regular contract outlines the terms of the agreement, a smart contract takes that one step further and enforces the terms of the agreement automatically on the blockchain, once the smart contract criteria are met.

Anyone with sufficient knowledge can write up a smart contract and add it to Ethereum blockchain. Once written and signed off by the vested parties, the smart contract is broadcast to the Ethereum network and stored there permanently.

Anyone can lookup the address of the contract on the Ethereum blockchain and use one of the publicly available tools to decode the code in contract and see what it can and can not do.

Smart contracts can hold large balances and operate their funds independently, fully managed by the underlying code powering the contract.

## Decentralized Applications

Decentralized Applications (aka DApps) are services built with the help of smart contracts. Smart contracts hold the rules according to which the DApp operates. A single DApp may consist of one or more interconnected smart contracts.

Although it may sound complicated, there is a very easy way to consider how DApps operate. A regular website or mobile app is centralized, using a centralized server where a single entity or organization controls everything to do with the service. The website or app could disappear at any time without warning, or the service users could experience censorship, outages and sudden changes.

Whereas, a decentralized app uses a distributed structure to protect against those issues. Once the DApp published on the blockchain and the service goes live, no single entity can make sweeping changes, and no entity can censor users from interacting with it. Unless the creator of the DApp deliberately adds means to do so. When such means are in place people can easily spot them as well.

At this point in time, there are thousands of DApps residing on Ethereum blockchain. Usually, DApps have some kind of token (unit of something) coded into its business logic as a means of measuring the value of something in the service DApp aims to provide. For instance, if a smart contract is built of an organization management a token can be used to identify the voting power or even a revenue share. 

Tokens belonging to popular DApps are usually become tradeable on public cryptocurrency exchanges. In that regards, these tokens are just like stocks that can rise and fall in value depending on the nature of the DApps and the market demand for its service

Below we will explore some real-world Ethereum DApps which managed to grow to a large service and currently valued in the range of hundreds of millions USD.

Most of the DApps built on Ethereum are financial services and often described as Decentralized Finance.

### 1) MakerDAO 

MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that functions entirely on Ethereum blockchain and managed by those in possession of special MKR tokens. In essence, MakerDAO is a lending facility that gives out loans for fees that are have to be paid in MKR tokens. The DAI is a stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, and the currency of the loans given by MakerDAO. The more loans there are the higher demand for MKR tokens.

MakerDAO is functioning autonomously, entirely on Ethereum blockchain. With about half a billion USD under its control MakerDAO is an ideal example for a type of financial services that can be built on Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can take out a loan from MakerDAO smart contract. The MKR token is available on many cryptocurrency exchanges and can be purchased by anyone.

### 2) 0x Protocol 

There are many organizations launching all kinds of tokens on Ethereum blockchain. Many of those tokens represent value and are traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. 0x protocol, a set of smart contracts on Ethereum, enables trading these tokens in a decentralized manner. 

ZRX is the native token for the 0x Protocol and plays a key role in exchanging tokens represented by different smart contracts. Moreover, holding ZRX token enables users to vote on improvements to 0x Protocol.

### 3) Exchange Tokens 

Several multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency exchanges provide a token that’s controlled by a smart contract on Ethereum. For the most part, these exchange tokens reduce transaction fees on the host exchange, offering users the chance to pay vastly reduced fees. The prominent examples of such tokens are Binance Coin (BNB) and Huobi Token (HT).

Having those tokens on a blockchain adds transparrency to the issuance as well as provides means for the exchanges to raise funds.

### 4) Stablecoins

There are a number of smart contracts representing stablecoins. Stablecoins are tokens that pegged to the value of something (usually USD) and generally 1 to 1 backed by liquid reserves. The biggest such stablecoin is Tether (USDT).

Tether often used by cryptocurrency users for quick swapping their holdings to USD at a 1:1 ratio.  USDC is another such stablecoin run by a different organization.

### 5) Basic Attention Token

Basic Attention Token (BAT) is the native token powering the Brave advertising platform. The BAT token integrated into the privacy-focused Brave web browser which is currently used by over 8 million people per month.

You see, a DApp can take many forms. The versatility of the Ethereum blockchain and its native programming language, Solidity, keep the doors of DApp development open.

## Interacting With DApps

Most of the DApps built on Ethereum blockchain are financial services. These services use Ether or some other Ethereum-based tokens. 

At this point the smart contracts powering these financial services cumulatively handle [over 1 billion USD](https://cointelegraph.com/news/value-locked-in-crypto-defi-markets-hits-1-billion-milestone) in value.



## Ethereum Privacy Explained

In the case of Bitcoin blockchain the address for receiving payments can change (but don’t have to) with each transaction. Keeping privacy in mind, most Bitcoin wallets generate a new address after each incoming payment making it considerably more difficult to connect two different transactions to a single party.

When it comes to Ethereum blockchain your address to receive Ether payments will always be the same. Nearly all Ethereum wallets work this way nowadays. This is likely to change in the future but for the time being that’s how most Ethereum wallets work. The wallets generate and use a single Ethereum address. There are other technical reasons for that.
The balance and transactions originating to/from specific payment addresses are stored in a visible manner on Ethereum blockchain.

The key takeaway point here is that Ethereum blockchain is fully transparent allowing anyone to see all incoming/outgoing transactions for the given payment address. On the other hand, when it comes to Bitcoin blockchain the relationship between transactions breaks when a user uses a new payment address for each incoming payment. 

As a result, in its current state, Bitcoin transactions in wallets provide users with more privacy than Ethereum transactions in that same wallet. 

The only thing that adds some minimal privacy element into the mix is the fact there is no way to check who that address belongs to. On the other hand, when you’re sending/receiving Ether, keep in mind that the other party can look up your balance as well as history of incoming/outgoing payments to/from that address.
With enough time and resources, someone could feasibly link certain transactions to individual users. If one of the cryptocurrency exchanges gets hacked and hackers get their hands on user data, this would potentially mean that someone can map Ethereum payment addresses to real world identities.
